# Big_Data_Final_Project

[Presentation link](http://prezi.com/xusx-vdbosup/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy)

Vast amounts of data are flowing at high velocity over the wire today. Organizations that can process and act on this streaming data in real time can dramatically improve efficiencies and differentiate themselves in the market. Scenarios of real-time streaming analytics can be found across all industries: personalized, real-time stock-trading analysis and alerts offered by financial services companies; real-time fraud detection; data and identity protection services; reliable ingestion and analysis of data generated by sensors and actuators embedded in physical objects (Internet of Things, or IoT); web clickstream analytics; and customer relationship management (CRM) applications issuing alerts when customer experience within a time frame is degraded. Businesses are looking for the most flexible, reliable and cost-effective way to do such real-time event-stream data analysis to succeed in the highly competitive modern business world.
The project aims at solving 2 important questions related to vehicular traffic:

1.	Spotting and reporting stolen cars
2.	Calculating and projecting the environmental aftermath of vehicles at any given location at a specified time


## PREREQUISITES
1. sudo chmod 755 to all 3 files (*.sh, *.py) (sudo chmod 755 *.sh)
2. install opnalpr and ffmpeg libraries 
   i. openalpr: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y openalpr openalpr-daemon openalpr-utils libopenalpr-dev
3. ffmpeg: sudo apt-get install ffmpeg)

## INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE CODE

1. Phase 1 needs to be executed in linux. The shell script runs phase 1. Inorder to run the shell script, run the following command in the terminal :

```
~/path-to-shell/vidmapred2.sh ~/path-to-video-folder/input_videos
```
NOTE : Please be careful about the path

2. Phase 2 can be executed in linux using mono and windows using visual studio. Update the `/input-file-path/` in the event listener `EntryStream/Program.cs` code to point at Phase1 output files `../java_MR_output/*`.

NOTE : The event listeners must be started before completion of Phase1 as it watches the files being dumped in `../java_MR_output/*`.

The Event-hub-listener parses input json and sends it to the Stream Analytics Job (NOTE : This is also already running on the cloud)

3. The final output can be seen as storage tables using Azure storage explorer and visualised in PowerBI dashboards.
